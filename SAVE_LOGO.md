   /Users/bubby/Desktop/ADS/frontend/static/images/logo.png
   ```

3. **Or use this command** if you have the logo file:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/your/logo.png /Users/bubby/Desktop/ADS/frontend/static/images/logo.png
   ```

## Logo Specifications:
- **Format**: PNG (with transparent background preferred)
- **Size**: Will be displayed at 80px height

## After saving the logo:

Run the preview app:

python3 preview_app.py
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

The logo will appear centered at the top with the scalloped border below it!
